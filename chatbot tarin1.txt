General Eye Health

Q: What are the most common causes of blindness and vision loss?
A: The leading causes of blindness and low vision are age-related diseases, including macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma.

Q: What are some common eye disorders?
A: Refractive errors, amblyopia (lazy eye), and strabismus are common eye disorders that affect vision quality.

Refractive Errors

Q: What are refractive errors?
A: Refractive errors occur when the eye cannot properly focus light, causing blurred vision. These include:

Myopia (nearsightedness) – Distant objects appear blurry.

Hyperopia (farsightedness) – Close objects appear blurry.

Astigmatism – Distorted or blurred vision at all distances.

Presbyopia – Age-related difficulty focusing on close objects.

Q: How can refractive errors be corrected?
A: They can be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery.

Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

Q: What is age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?
A: AMD is a disease that damages central vision, making it difficult to read and drive. It affects the macula, the part of the retina that allows for detailed vision.

Q: What are the types of AMD?
A: There are two types:

Wet AMD – Caused by abnormal blood vessel growth, leading to fluid leakage.

Dry AMD – The macula gradually thins over time, leading to central vision loss.

Cataracts

Q: What are cataracts?
A: Cataracts cause clouding of the eye’s lens, leading to blurry vision. It is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.

Q: How are cataracts treated?
A: Cataracts can be removed with surgery, where the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial one.

Diabetic Retinopathy

Q: What is diabetic retinopathy (DR)?
A: DR is a complication of diabetes that damages the blood vessels in the retina, leading to vision loss.

Q: How can diabetic retinopathy be prevented?
A: Managing blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol can reduce the risk.

Glaucoma

Q: What is glaucoma?
A: Glaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss.

Q: What are the types of glaucoma?
A:

Open-angle glaucoma – Develops slowly without symptoms.

Closed-angle glaucoma – Sudden onset with pain and rapid vision loss.

Q: How is glaucoma treated?
A: Treatments include eye drops, laser therapy, and surgery.

Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)

Q: What is amblyopia?
A: Amblyopia, or lazy eye, occurs when one eye does not develop properly, leading to reduced vision in that eye.

Q: Can amblyopia be treated?
A: Yes, treatments include eye patches, corrective lenses, and vision therapy.

Strabismus

Q: What is strabismus?
A: Strabismus is a condition where the eyes are misaligned, either crossing inward (esotropia) or outward (exotropia).

Q: How is strabismus treated?
A: Treatments include eyeglasses, vision therapy, and surgery in severe cases.

Importance of Eye Exams

Q: Why are regular eye exams important?
A: Many eye diseases develop without symptoms. Regular exams help detect problems early when treatment is most effective.

Q: How often should I get an eye exam?

Children: At least once between ages 3–5.

People with diabetes: Every year.

Adults over 60: Every 2 years.

Preventing Vision Loss

Q: What can I do to protect my vision?

Have regular eye exams.

Wear protective eyewear during sports or hazardous activities, and choose sunglasses that block 99-100% of UV rays to shield your eyes from sun damage.

Follow a healthy diet rich in leafy greens and omega-3 fatty acids.

Manage chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.

Quit smoking, as it increases the risk of eye diseases.
